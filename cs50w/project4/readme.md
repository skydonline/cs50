# Social Media Network by Sky

## Background:

Created a social media network, similar to Instagram.

The main purpose of this project was to learn about REST APIs, knowing how to efficiently communicate between the backend and frontend, and enhance my understanding of various languages/tools `(Django, Python, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, etc.)`.

#### Major Learnings:

-   Learned how to create my own REST APIs to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data from the database
-   Learned how to utilize JavaScript to create a responsive, interactive and engaging user experience
-   Learned how to use Django to help facilitate a web application
    -   Database interaction, URL routing, view/form handling, authentication/authorization

    -   Uses a REST API to fetch the post data, then dynamically loads onto screen
-   **Dark Mode**
    -   Instantly switch between dark mode and light mode, with a fading animation
    -   Changing theme doesn't refresh page, and database saves user's preference
    -   Preserves colour of certain items `(e.g. images)`
-   **Change settings and password**
    -   If any field is empty, alerts user to fill in those fields
        -   Gives a message and highlights the missing input fields
    -   Change settings/password button is deactivated until user has properly filled in form
    -   Prevents user from changing password if new password and confirm password fields don't match
