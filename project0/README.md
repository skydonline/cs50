Chose not to implement full Google CSS styling, feels redundant considering I have made my own website. Implemented core Google search features, such as regular search, image search, and advanced search.

Primairly learned how to manipulate input fields, understanding search queries and reinforced understanding of HTML layout (DOM - Document Object Model).

This is just testing the new branch.
